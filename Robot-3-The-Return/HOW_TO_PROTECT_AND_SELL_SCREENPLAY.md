## PART 1: PROTECTING YOUR SCREENPLAY

### Step 1: Copyright Registration in India (RECOMMENDED FIRST)

Your script is **automatically protected** the moment it's written under the Copyright Act 1957. However, **registration provides legal evidence**.

**Copyright Office of India:**
- Website: https://copyright.gov.in/
- Cost: Approximately Rs. 500-2000
- Duration: Lifetime of author + 60 years
- **Why do this:** Strongest legal protection in India. Essential for any lawsuit.

### Step 2: Screenwriters Association (SWA) Registration

The SWA is recognized by the entire Indian film industry.

**SWA Registration:**
- Website: https://swaindia.org/
- Become an Associate Member first
- Then register: Synopsis, Story, Script, Screenplay, Dialogue
- **Benefits:**
  - Dispute resolution committee
  - Legal officer support
  - Industry-recognized proof of authorship

**For Tamil Cinema specifically:**
- You can also register with **SWAN** (South Indian Film Writers Association)
- Both SWA and SWAN accept non-professional writers as Associate Members

### Step 3: WGA (Writers Guild of America) Registration

Useful if you want international protection or Hollywood interest.

**WGA West Registry:**
- Website: https://www.wgawregistry.org/
- Cost: $20 for non-members
- Duration: 5 years (renewable)
- **Why do this:** Instant timestamp of authorship, recognized internationally

### Step 4: U.S. Copyright Office (Optional - For International Markets)

**U.S. Copyright Office:**
- Website: https://www.copyright.gov/
- Cost: $45-65 online, up to $125 for physical
- **Why do this:** Required for statutory damages in U.S. lawsuits

### Quick Self-Protection Methods

While getting formal registration:
1. **Email yourself the complete screenplay** - creates a timestamped record
2. **Post to yourself via Registered Post** (don't open the envelope) - "poor man's copyright"
3. **GitHub commit history** - Your repo now has timestamped public proof!

Dear [Producer/Development Executive],

### Step 3: Understanding the Deal

**Option Agreement:**
- Producer pays ~10% of purchase price for exclusive rights (1-2 years)
- If movie gets made, they pay full price
- If not, rights return to you (you keep option fee)

- New writers: May be lower, but negotiate credit and backend

## PART 4: IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTES

### Regarding Robot/Enthiran Franchise

**IMPORTANT:** The Robot/Enthiran franchise is owned intellectual property. Characters like:
- Dr. Vaseegaran
- Chitti
- The Robot universe

...are likely owned by the original creators/production companies.

**Your Options:**

1. **Sell as a "spec script"** - A proposal for the existing franchise
   - You're essentially pitching a sequel idea
   - They would pay for your story/screenplay contribution
   - They own the characters; you're offering a story

2. **Create an original work inspired by the themes**
   - Change character names, settings
   - Create your own "aged scientist + robot" universe
   - Own 100% of the IP

3. **Collaborate with rights holders**
   - Approach Lyca Productions/S. Shankar directly
   - Propose as a "story by" contribution
   - Negotiate credit and payment
