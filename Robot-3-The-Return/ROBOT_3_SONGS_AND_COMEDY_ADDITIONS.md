# NEW COMEDY CHARACTERS

## 1. MUTHU - Dr. Vaseegaran's Assistant (Comedy Track - Main)

**Character:** MUTHU (45), has been Dr. Vaseegaran's loyal assistant for 30 years. Short, pudgy, talks too much, scared of everything but deeply loyal. He was there during Chitti 1.0 and 2.0 - traumatized but still working.

**Personality:**
- Constantly complains but never leaves
- Talks to Chitti's deactivated body like it's a person
- Terrified of robots but works with them
- Makes Tamil jokes and references old movies
- Says "Aiyayo!" at every crisis

**Sample Dialogues:**

```
MUTHU
(seeing Chitti wake up)
Aiyayo! Not again! Last time he woke up, half of Chennai
became scrap metal! Sir, can we put him back to sleep?
Please? I have a wedding to attend next month!

DR. VASEEGARAN
Muthu, the world is ending.

MUTHU
Sir, the world is always ending when Chitti wakes up!
This is the third time! I should have taken that job
at the post office when I had the chance!
```

```
MUTHU
(to deactivated Chitti, daily routine)
Good morning, Chitti sir. Please continue sleeping.
No need to wake up. Everything is peaceful. Chennai
is boring. Nothing exciting happening. Sleep well.
(turns to leave, whispers)
Don't wake up. Don't wake up. Don't wake up.
```

---

## 2. VEERAPPAN - Night Security Guard (Comedy Track - Supporting)

**Character:** VEERAPPAN (60), retired army, now security guard at Dr. Vaseegaran's house. Thinks he's still in the military. Salutes everything. Half-deaf but pretends he hears everything.

**Personality:**
- Salutes even the refrigerator
- Mishears everything creating comedy
- Has elaborate conspiracy theories
- Falls asleep on duty but claims he was "tactical resting"

**Sample Dialogues:**

```
VEERAPPAN
(when aliens arrive)
Sir! I knew it! I always said the government is hiding
something! My cousin's wife's brother saw a UFO in 1987!
Nobody believed him! Now who's laughing?
(nobody is laughing)
WHY IS NOBODY LAUGHING?!

MUTHU
Because aliens are attacking, you old fool!

VEERAPPAN
What? Onions are attacking? Where?!
```

---

## 3. PAKKU & SOKKU - Twin Neighbor Kids (Comedy + Heart)

**Characters:** PAKKU and SOKKU (10), twin boys from the neighboring house. They sneak into Dr. Vaseegaran's compound to see "the robot uncle." Comic relief but also emotional anchor - they represent innocence and hope.

**Sample Scene:**

```
PAKKU
(peeking through window at Chitti)
Anna, do you think robot uncle dreams?

SOKKU
Robots don't dream, stupid. They're machines.

PAKKU
Then why does he look sad when he sleeps?

(Dr. Vaseegaran overhears - emotional moment)
```

---

## 4. KANCHANA - The Thief (Comedy + Plot Connection)

**Character:** KANCHANA (35), a bumbling thief who picks the WRONG house to rob - Dr. Vaseegaran's. She accidentally becomes important to the plot.

### THIEF SUBPLOT:

**PART 1 (Robot 3.1):**

**Scene: KANCHANA BREAKS IN (Night before Zara arrives)**

```
INT. DR. VASEEGARAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

KANCHANA sneaks in through a window. She's a "professional"
thief but clearly incompetent.

KANCHANA
(whispering to herself)
Rich scientist house. Must have expensive equipment.
Gold. Diamonds. Maybe a Nobel Prize I can sell.

She tiptoes through the living room. Sees awards on wall.

KANCHANA (CONT'D)
"Bharat Ratna"... is that real gold?
(tries to take it, it's bolted)
Cheap government. Can't even give real gold.

She finds the basement stairs. Goes down.

Sees CHITTI in the glass case. Freezes.

KANCHANA (CONT'D)
(terrified whisper)
Shiva Shiva Shiva... Is that... is that THE Chitti?!
The robot that destroyed Chennai?!

She backs away slowly. Trips. Falls. Makes noise.

TOASTER (Domestic Robot) rolls in.

TOASTER
Intruder detected. Alerting authorities.

KANCHANA
No no no! Please! I'm not a thief! I'm... I'm...
the new maid! Night shift maid!

TOASTER
There is no night shift maid. You are lying.
Your heart rate indicates deception.

KANCHANA
Okay okay I'm a thief! But please don't call police!
I have three children!
(she doesn't)
And a sick mother!
(her mother is fine)
And a... a... dying goldfish!

TOASTER
Processing emotional manipulation...
Manipulation detected. Calling police.

KANCHANA
(desperate)
What if I can help you? I can clean! Cook!
I make excellent sambar!

DR. VASEEGARAN appears at the top of stairs.

DR. VASEEGARAN
Toaster, what's happening?

TOASTER
Sir, I caught a thief. She claims to make excellent sambar.

DR. VASEEGARAN
(sighs)
It's 3 AM. I'm too old for this.
```

### KANCHANA'S ROLE IN THE PLOT:

**Why she matters:** Kanchana witnessed Zara's arrival (she was hiding in the garden, too scared to leave). Later, when the government is hunting for Zara, Kanchana provides a crucial alibi/distraction.

**Part 1 - Act 2:**
```
INT. DR. VASEEGARAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Military surrounds the house looking for Zara.

ARJUN
Father, where is the alien?

KANCHANA
(bursting in, acting)
ALIEN?! What alien?! I've been here all night!
I'm the new... night maid! I saw nothing!
No glowing woman! No spaceship! Nothing!

Everyone stares at her.

ARJUN
Who is this woman?

DR. VASEEGARAN
She's... my new assistant.

MUTHU
(offended)
WHAT?! I've been your assistant for 30 years!

DR. VASEEGARAN
Assistant's assistant.

MUTHU
That's not a thing!

KANCHANA
(whispering to Dr. Vaseegaran)
Sir, I'll help you hide the alien lady. But you
have to promise not to report my... earlier visit.

DR. VASEEGARAN
(whispering back)
You tried to rob me.

KANCHANA
Attempted. I didn't succeed. That's not a crime.

DR. VASEEGARAN
It's literally a crime.

KANCHANA
Details, sir. Details.
```

**Part 2 - Kanchana's Redemption:**
During the final battle, Kanchana helps evacuate civilians using her "thief skills" (knowing hidden routes, shortcuts, escape paths).

```
KANCHANA
(leading civilians through back alleys)
Follow me! I know every hidden path in Chennai!
(to herself)
Finally, my criminal knowledge is useful!
```

of this house. Even when I sleep.

Wow! Can you do a magic trick?

Vacuuming. Reminding about medicine. Ordering
groceries. And... and... 44 more I cannot recall

I have 7.2 million functions.

Show off.

proving something that you forgot how to feel!

ARJUN
I have to prove I'm not just "Vaseegaran's son"!

And in doing so, you've become exactly what
you hate about your father - someone so obsessed

That's... the first honest thing you've said in years.

Go. Save the world. Then come back and say that again.

ARJUN
I love you.

I know. Now go.
