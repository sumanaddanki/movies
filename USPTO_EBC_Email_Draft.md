# Email Draft for USPTO EBC

**To:** ebc@uspto.gov

**Subject:** Urgent: Empty Document Display for Provisional Application 63/956,810 - Request for Verification

---

Dear USPTO Patent Electronic Business Center,

I am writing to request urgent assistance regarding my recently filed provisional patent application. When I attempt to preview the application in Patent Center, the document appears to be empty, and I am concerned that my specification may not have been properly received.

**Application Details:**

| Field | Information |
|-------|-------------|
| Application Number | 63/956,810 |
| Title | QUAD Platform: Compliance-Aware AI Code Generation System with Zero Hallucination |
| Filing Date | January 9, 2026 |
| First Named Inventor | Gopi S Addanke |
| Patent Center Submission # | 73904030 |

**Issue Description:**

When I click "Preview" for this application in Patent Center (under Saved Submissions), the document that opens appears to be empty/blank. I successfully filed two other provisional applications on January 9-10, 2026 (Application Numbers 63/957,071 and 63/957,663), and those preview correctly with full content.

**My Requests:**

1. Please verify whether the specification and any drawings for application 63/956,810 were successfully received and recorded by the USPTO.

2. If the documents were not received or are incomplete, please advise on the process to submit the missing documents while retaining my original filing date of January 9, 2026.

3. If a petition is required, please provide guidance on which form to use and the applicable fees.

**Contact Information:**

- Name: Gopi S Addanke
- Email: [YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]
- Phone: [YOUR PHONE NUMBER]
- Address: [YOUR MAILING ADDRESS]

I would greatly appreciate a prompt response given the time-sensitive nature of patent filing dates. Please let me know if you need any additional information to locate my application or resolve this issue.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Gopi S Addanke
Applicant / Inventor
